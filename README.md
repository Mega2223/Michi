## The cutest Kotlin bot for discord!
Let the tanuki girl into your server and have fun with her commands, such as `/math` and `/raccoon` (my personal favorite).<br>
Michi is a non-profitable project, this means that there isn't any premium command that you need to pay to use. 
I made this project solely as a way to learn more about Kotlin and as a labour of love, so I don't think it'd be fair to charge any amount of money.

## ❓ Can I add her to my server?
Sadly, you can't yet. <br>
Soon enough you will be able to add the tanuki into your server. <br>
When I release Michi, I will paste the invite link here.

## 📘 TOS
If you want to use Michi's commands, you will need to follow a couple of rules. <br>
There isn't any yet, since the bot isn't public yet, but if I create the TOS, I will link it here.
