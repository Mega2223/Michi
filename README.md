## The cutest Kotlin bot for discord!
Let the tanuki girl into your server and have fun with her commands, such as ``/math`` and ``/raccoon`` (my personal favorite)

## ❓ Can I add her to my server?
Sadly, you can't yet. <br>
Since the bot is pretty much is her early stages and I'm a beginner programmer, it will take some time before I release it. <br>
If I release it, I will paste the link here.

## 📝 Commands
You can find Michi's commands [here](https://github.com/slz-br/Michi/blob/main/Commands.md#commands)

## 📘 TOS
If you want to use Michi's commands, you will need to follow a couple of rules. <br>
There isn't any yet, since the bot isn't public yet, but if I create the TOS, I will link it here.
